## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flexbox

### What I learned

Practiced more on using flexbox and responsive design 

### Continued development

I will be more consistent and clear while naming the classes and sections. It makes a little bit confusion when I work on bigger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Color Picker Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) - This helped me to pick colors not in the style guide and I use this extension a lot in several projects.
